======================= HUNTERS ====================================
* Split roles for each hunter (2 search in an area while others specifically look for trail). When one hunter  
encounters dracula all hunters converge on the location but avoid going along the same path. They should try
to enclose dracula by approaching in a wide formation

* When dracula is at sea have hunters split up and each go to a city next to the sea (since dracula must go to
one of these cities when exiting the sea) if it is within range for the next move or two. There is a chance
one of them will run into dracula as soon as he reammerges from the ocean

* Never have two or more hunters in the same city unless dracula is there, this waste an opportunity to catch
dracula when he escapes to adjacent cities

* When a hunter step into the trap, he need to figure out the possible location that dracula can go to from that place
  And everyone just gather around to that area

* When player have no clews what is going on with dracula, just groofing around

* Use message to communicate? 
* Yes. Set Lord Goldming as the 'Supreme Leader' of the team. He will send out the location that each player should go to at their next term
* For Lord Goldming, he will read the infomation from the last player (Mina Hawker), if dracula has no recent move for analyse
* he will pass on the infomation for the next player
* Use the BFS to find the shortest distance from dracula to each player (if known)
* Message: Read only the message from the last player
* first letter is the number including 1, 2, 3 represent different message type
* 1 stands for a standard message
* 0 stands for a NONE message: stands for "okay just hang around, I have no idea wtf happened"
* first three letter represent the destination of the target
* follow by the location that hunters should go to at the next turn
* Message form: N..N..N..N..N..
* string length =
* for instance Dr seward will have a message in form ... .. .. ..
* while mina hawker will have a message in form ... ..
* Usually, Once Encounter || traps || dracula are spoted
* Lord Goldaming will spread out the infos so that others can go and trace it
* If during the turns of other players some other traps || encounters are spoted
* the player can switch the message so that others can go and trace 
* destination change IF AND ONLY IF a new trap || encounters were spot last term

* new strategy uploaded, need to be classify



*basic strategy of hunter 
*   read the message for instruction for the next move
*       if(current state change) change the message & instruction
*   make a new move
*   pass on the message


======================= DRACULA ====================================
* When score is low and hp is high enough go to sea and stay there since the game 
  will end before dracula's health depletes



======================= Questions ==================================
* If the 6th past play was a "HI"|| "DB", can dracula make a HI or DB at the current turn?
